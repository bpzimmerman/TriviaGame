        answer: "80%",
        trivia: "Smoke inhalation is the primary cause of death for victims of indoor fires. The inhalation or exposure to hot gaseous products of combustion can cause serious respiratory complications. The hot smoke injures or kills by a combination of thermal damage, poisoning and pulmonary irritation and swelling, caused by carbon monoxide, cyanide and other combustion products."

        question: "To what familiar fruit is the plantain similar?",
        choices: ["Mangos", "Bananas", "Kiwi", "Papaya"],
        answer: "Bananas",
        trivia: "Plantains are closely related to the common banana, but the fruit, which is green, is typically larger than the common banana. The edible fruit of the plantain has more starch than the banana and is not eaten raw. Because plantains have a maximum of starch before they ripen, they are usually cooked green, either boiled or fried, often with coconut juice or sugar as a flavouring. They may also be dried for later use in cooking or ground for use as a meal. The plantain meal can be further refined to a flour."
