        question: "What weather phenomenon causes more deaths in the U.S. annually than any other except lightning?",
        choices: ["Tornados", "Hurricanes", "Snowstorms", "Hail"],
        answer: "Tornados",
        trivia: "Most tornados have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour (180 km/h), are about 250 feet (80 m) across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating. The most extreme tornados can attain wind speeds of more than 300 miles per hour (480 km/h), are more than two miles (3 km) in diameter, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km). On average, tornados cause 1500 injuries and 80 deaths per year in the United States."

        question: "What name is given to wood whose normal cells have been replaced with mineral deposits?",
        choices: ["Petrified Wood", "Stone Timber", "Rock Lumber", "Gravel Wood"],
        answer: "Petrified Wood",
        trivia: "Unlike other types of fossils which are typically impressions or compressions, petrified wood is a three-dimensional representation of the original organic material. Mineral-laden water deposits minerals in the plant's cells and as the plant's lignin and cellulose decay, a stone mold forms in its place."

    q3:{
        question: "What is pollination by birds is called?",
        choices: ["Autogamy", "Ornithophily", "Entomophily", "Anemophily"],
        answer: "Ornithophily",
        trivia: "Bird pollination is considered as a costly strategy for plants and it evolves only where there are particular benefits for the plant. High altitude ecosystems that lack insect pollinators, those in dry regions or isolated islands tend to favour the evolution of ornithophily in plants."

        question: "Unlike rodents, rabbits have how many incisor teeth?",
        choices: ["Two", "Three", "Four", "Six"],
        answer: "Four",
        trivia: "The teeth of rabbits are similar and yet different from rodents. Both rodents and rabbits have a indeterminate growth in their incisors (they grow constantly). They also have hard enamel on the external surface of the incisors and a soft dentin behind, but the front of rabbit incisors is white and not orange like rodents. Rabbits also have two sets of top incisors, not one."

        question: "What percent of fire-related deaths are due to smoke inhalation rather than burns?",
        choices: ["10%", "50%", "80%", "99%"],
        answer: "80%",
        trivia: "Smoke inhalation is the primary cause of death for victims of indoor fires. The inhalation or exposure to hot gaseous products of combustion can cause serious respiratory complications. The hot smoke injures or kills by a combination of thermal damage, poisoning and pulmonary irritation and swelling, caused by carbon monoxide, cyanide and other combustion products."

        question: "To what familiar fruit is the plantain similar?",
        choices: ["Mangos", "Bananas", "Kiwi", "Papaya"],
        answer: "Bananas",
        trivia: "Plantains are closely related to the common banana, but the fruit, which is green, is typically larger than the common banana. The edible fruit of the plantain has more starch than the banana and is not eaten raw. Because plantains have a maximum of starch before they ripen, they are usually cooked green, either boiled or fried, often with coconut juice or sugar as a flavouring. They may also be dried for later use in cooking or ground for use as a meal. The plantain meal can be further refined to a flour."

The area of the United States that he placed under public protection totals approximately 230,000,000 acres (930,000 km2)."

        question: "What wonder drug was used for three years by the Army and Navy before becoming available to the general public in 1944?",
        choices: ["Penicillin", "Quinine", "Streptomycin", "Sulfanilamide"],
        answer: "Penicillin",
        trivia: "The Scottish bacteriologist Sir Alexander Fleming, (1881-1955), discovered penicillin in 1928, but could not make enough penicillin to be useful in practice and his discovery was dismissed as no more than a laboratory curiosity. Ten years later, a team of scientists at Oxford University rediscovered Fleming's work, but unable to engage British companies due to the country's involvement in World War II, the Oxford scientists sought help in America.  Pfizer began producing penicillin in 1941, but it wasn't until the fall of 1942 that scientists were finally able to produce a stable form of the substance in sufficient quantities to make it commercially viable."

        question: "Which sea is the saltiest natural lake and is also at the lowest elevation on the face of the earth?",
        choices: ["The Dead Sea", "The Great Salt Lake", "Lake Tuz", "The Caspian Sea"],

Its surface and shores are 430.5 metres (1,412 ft) below sea level, Earth's lowest elevation on land. The Dead Sea is 304 m (997 ft) deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With a salinity of 342 g/kg, or 34.2%, (in 2011), it is 9.6 times as salty as the ocean and one of the world's saltiest bodies of water. This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which plants and animals cannot flourish, hence its name."

        question: "Bees must collect nectar from approximately how many flowers to make 1 pound of honeycomb?",
        choices: ["10 thousand", "2 million", "20 million", "50 million"],
        answer: "20 million",
        trivia: "Nectar is usually secreted from glands called floral nectaries that are found in various places in a flower depending on the species. They are usually found at the base, but may also be on the sepals, petals, or stamens. Bees have tube-like mouthparts that can reach deep into a flower like a straw. The nectar is swallowed into an organ known as the honey stomach (a part of the esophagus that expands as it fills). Once the honey stomach is full the bee returns to the hive where the payload is transferred to a waiting worker in a process called trophallaxis and the long process of converting nectar into honey begins."

        trivia: "Albacore (Thunnus alalunga) is one of the eight tuna species belonging to the Thunnus genus. It is the only tuna species that can be marketed as white meat in the United States. The albacore is a very economically important fish and is a target of commercial and recreational fisheries. It was originally the basis for the United States tuna-canning industry and is no less important today, making up significant percentages of the gross domestic products of various Pacific nations. It is listed as Near Threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) because of the threat of overfishing. Several stocks are in significant decline and the species' overall population trend is decreasing."

        question: "What is the only species of cat that lives and hunts in groups?",
        choices: ["Lion", "Leopard", "Jaguar", "Cougar"],
        answer: "Lion",
        trivia: "Lions live together in prides and hunt in groups, mainly at night, stalking and encircling prey until one of the hunters is close enough to pounce. Stealthy hunting groups, mostly made up of lionesses, spread out to cover large distances and quietly move closer to the targeted prey. Lions often hunt at night to reduce their visibility and wait until they are 10 to 30 yards from their prey before charging forward. In some cases, lions use their massive paws and sharp claws to strike prey and achieve a firm grip. In other kills, they take animals by surprise with a quick bite on a vulnerable area of the body."
